# Joannify
This program replaces all pictures on the page with Joanna's face.  In the future, we hope to implement random pictures of Joanna's face instead of just one measly photo of Joanna's face.

#BETA: 
To run: Go to about:debugging in your firefox browser. Click load temporary add-on and navigate to and click joannify.js. Now every photo in your browser, when you right click and select view image, turns into a photo of Joanna!
